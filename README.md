Data analyst role work about traffic accidents that occurred between the years 2016-2021, in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Argentina (CABA).
Traffic accidents are one of the main causes of death and injuries in the city. According to the Buenos Aires government, the factors that contribute to accidents are non-compliance with traffic laws, excessive speed, failure to respect traffic signs, failure to use a seat belt or headrest, and driving while tired. Furthermore, the means of transportation most involved in accidents are motorcycles, followed by cars and buses. Traffic accidents generate a high social and economic cost, as well as a negative impact on people's quality of life.

Databases are provided with information about homicides and victims (data from official Argentine websites).
An ETL and EDA are carried out, respectively, using Jupyter notebook, Pandas library, and its final presentation in PowerBI.

Requested KPIs:
* 1)
Reduce by 10% the homicide rate in road accidents in the last six months, in CABA, compared to the homicide rate in road accidents in the previous semester (semester year 2021-2020). We define the homicide rate in road accidents as the number of fatal victims in traffic accidents per 100,000 inhabitants in a geographic area during a specific period of time. Its formula is: (Number of homicides in road accidents / Total population) * 100,000.

* 2)
Reduce the number of fatal motorcyclist accidents by 7% in the last year, in CABA, compared to the previous year (year 2021-2020). We define the number of fatal accidents involving motorcyclists in road accidents as the absolute number of fatal accidents in which victims traveling by motorcycle were involved in a certain time period. Its formula to measure the evolution of fatal accidents with motorcycle victims is: (Number of fatal accidents with motorcycle victims in the previous year - Number of fatal accidents with motorcycle victims in the current year) / (Number of fatal accidents with motorcycle victims in the previous year) * 100.

* 3)
With data on the number of victims per commune, the communes with the most accidents are taken to calculate the mortality rate from road accidents. To do this, you must divide the number of fatalities by the number of inhabitants of each commune and multiply by 100,000. This results in the mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants, which is a standardized indicator that allows comparisons between communes.
